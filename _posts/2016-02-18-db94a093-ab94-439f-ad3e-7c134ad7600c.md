How to migrate a whole mess of content to SharePoint 2013...

Our main issue: file path lenghts.

We started out using a sweet tool from OrbitOne, it is open source and looked like it was going to do the job.. but it crashed every time it found either a system file whose path was too long or a destination url was too long. We had some wonky file paths...

So, we decided to build our own importer. We wrote a web service that essentially placed the file in SharePoint and a nodejs client that ran on the fileshare server. It iterated through all of the files, read them, uploaded the file path and bytes. We allowed it to process 20 items at a time.
